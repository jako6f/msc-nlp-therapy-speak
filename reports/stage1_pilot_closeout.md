# Stage 1 Pilot Closeout

- Crawls: CC-MAIN-2016-44, CC-MAIN-2026-04
- Sampling: K=2 WET files per crawl
- Total docs scanned: 157,461
- Hits total: 728
- Hit rate (hits / docs >= min chars): 0.005

Top observations:
- Substantial boilerplate/chrome hits
- Domain cap not triggered at this scale
- ASD disambiguation works as intended

Next step:
- Stage 1b micro-iterations to reduce boilerplate using heuristics, validated by spot-checking
