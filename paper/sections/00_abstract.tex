This dissertation investigates whether ``therapy-speak'' related to ADHD and autism has increased in general web discourse over the last decade, and how the surrounding language and framing may have shifted over time. Using Common Crawl as a large-scale web archive, I implement a reproducible pipeline that samples one crawl per year and extracts plaintext (WET) documents for trend estimation and a smaller, deeper corpus for downstream NLP analysis. The study emphasises methodological feasibility: principled sampling, robust filtering, contextual disambiguation, and domain caps to prevent large publishers from dominating the dataset.
