\section*{No-copy--paste outputs}
Figures are generated by code into \texttt{../reports/figures/} and included via \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics}. Tables are generated by code into \texttt{../reports/tables/} and included via \texttt{\textbackslash input}.

\paragraph{Pilot validation outputs.}
Stage~1 pilot validation outputs are provided in the Appendix (see Appendix~A), documenting throughput, hit-rate, domain concentration, and the observed boilerplate issue that Stage~1b will mitigate.
