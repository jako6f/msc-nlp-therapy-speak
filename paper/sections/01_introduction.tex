  \item How has the prevalence of ADHD- and autism-related terminology in general web discourse changed over approximately the last 10 years?
  \item How has the surrounding context and framing of these terms shifted over time (e.g., clinical vs. everyday usage; self-identification; moral/emotional framing)?
