Chosen Stage 1 pilot snapshot option: use CC-MAIN-2016-44 and CC-MAIN-2026-04.
This pairs an older 2016 crawl with a recent 2026 crawl for temporal contrast.
2016-44 is close to the prior 2016-40 entry, keeping continuity while updating.
2026-04 replaces 2024-42 to reflect the latest available snapshot window.
The pair balances historical coverage with current web content for sampling.
Kept the set small (two crawls) to limit pilot scope and cost.
